# Fltk Text Editor
Simple text editor written in C++ using FLTK toolkit. Currently under development and packages, installation scripts will be added when I finish developing most of the essential features. I also plan to record some videos to show how to build one yourself.
This one is being developed on FLTK 1.4.4
